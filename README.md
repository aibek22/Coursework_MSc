#### This repository contains notebooks with my solution to the following coursework assignments from my MSc studies at Imperial College.

### Assignments:
- Genetic drift refers to the variation in gene variant frequencies within a population across generations. An individualâ€™s alleles represent a subset of those inherited from their parents, and random chance influences their survival and reproductive success. This process can lead to the complete loss of certain gene variants within a population, ultimately diminishing genetic diversity. The 'Genetic_Drift.ipnb' notebook contains simulations for the genetic drift models.

- The 'Python_Assessment.ipnb' notebook contains solutions to the following bioinformatics problems:
  <br>
  1. ORF Prediction
  2. Sequence Alignment Scoring
  3. Amino Acid Property Plotting
