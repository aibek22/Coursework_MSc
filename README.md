### Assignments:
- Genetic drift refers to the variation in gene variant frequencies within a population across generations. An individualâ€™s alleles represent a subset of those inherited from their parents, and random chance influences their survival and reproductive success. This process can lead to the complete loss of certain gene variants within a population, ultimately diminishing genetic diversity. The notebook provides simulations for the genetic drift models.
